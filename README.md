# Big-Data-Analytics_SparkR_NYC-Parking-tickets
An exploratory data analysis to help understand Big data using SparkR

New York City is a thriving metropolis. Just like most other metros that size, one of the biggest problems its citizens face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a huge number of parking tickets.
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department has collected data for parking tickets. Out of these, the data files from 2014 to 2017 are publicly available on Kaggle. Spark will allow us to analyse the full files at high speeds, as opposed to taking a series of random samples that will approximate the population.

For the scope of this analysis, we wish to compare the phenomenon related to parking tickets over three different years - 2015, 2016, 2017.
The purpose of this case study is to conduct an exploratory data analysis to help understand the data.
